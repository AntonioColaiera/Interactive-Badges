# Interactive-Badges
I used PUG, SASS and JS for an exercise for a selection process for the Renoon company.

Here are the instructions:

- The sustainability badges (animal welfare and Blockchain traced) must be reusable mixins inside a loop, not hardcoded since they can be more than 2
- It doesn't matter if the icons you see in the screenshot are not the same, just use some svg icons that are similar and openly available
- The change in color of the badge happens when the mouse goes hover the badge and when the badge is clicked
- When a badge is clicked the grey box appears with some content related to the clicked badge (so content is dynamic based on which badge is clicked)
- When the other badge is clicked, the previously clicked badge returns to the normal color, and the content in the grey box updates
- Add an animation to the opening of the grey box, you can pick the animation you prefer.
